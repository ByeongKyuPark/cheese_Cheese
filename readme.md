Description
    A game in which you win each round by acquiring yellow cheese.
    If a mouse is caught in a trap or by a cat, it dies.
    The wheel can be used to either block cats or obstruct the trap.
    Cats snooze when the mouse is out of sight for more than one second. You can hide from the cat in the closet as well.
    Cats can be slowed down by pouring water on the floor.
    Records are kept for the top three finishers in each round.

    This game was created by a first-year game team called "77," which consisted of four students. I was the lead programmer, producer, graphics, physics, and Enemy AI programmer. This game took three months to finish.

Target operating system
